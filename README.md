# Mobile-Architect-Programming
project from my mobile development class

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The goals of the app was to organize and show data regarding an inventory of the user. The user would need ot be able to add, delete and edit products of various amounts and names. The user required that I add ways to edit the amounts of items, add items, remove items, and verify users.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  I required 3 screens, One for logging in the user, one for showing the user the inventory from a database and finally a prompt that appreared to allow the user to accept or deny push notefications.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I used a typical approch of organization and smooth usage. I kept my code named and commented in an organized way to make it easier for me to work. I then used my experience with mobile apps to find way to make the use of my app easier. example is when adding and changing the items, the user needs not to change screens or refresh the app. The edit can happen on the same screen while also automatically refreshing the screen to the list is updated. 
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  i Used all the debugging tools avaiable. Using logcat in androud studio was my favorite since i gave me ideas about what was crashing my app and where to look for fixes. I used android studio's built in debigger that let me view each step to follow how values are changing and exactly what piece of code is going wrong.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  When builiding a system for editing an item without adding another screen i had to get creative and reused some parts of my code which resulted in a system that saves time, space, and user headaches. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I thing the inventory app looks and feels nature since my job at publixx resulted in a year of expierence dealing with a similar giving me plenty to think of when building this app.
